    <h1>You can write your thoughts here</h1>
    <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>
    <h3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</h3>
    <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>
    <h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

    <div>This exercise is about nesting div tags</div>
    <div>This div contains this text and the div tag below
        <div>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs
            <div>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</div>

        This exercise is about making lists

        <ul>Here's what I like about lists:</ul>
        <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
        <li>That's about it</li>
        <li>I'm gonna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>

        <ol>When you make a list, do it in this order: 
        <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
        <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag
            <ol>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items
                <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li>
            </ol>   
        </li>
        <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
        </ol>

    <div>
        <ul>Here's a couple ways you can express yourself
            <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
            <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
            <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <div>You did it! You should be proud of yourself</div>
